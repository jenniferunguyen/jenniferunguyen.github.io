# Step 4 Lambda Calculus

Lambda calculus is both fun and confusing to first understand. Lambda calculus consists of 3 types of expressions. 
```
E :: = x 
E1 E2
\x.E
```
E signifies an expression. First, an expression is made up of variables. Second. two expressions next to each other means that the first expression takes the second expression as input. Third, to define what the expression does, use a \ before the variables that the expression fill the inputs as then a period. This will be used just to referring to Lambda Calculus, because it is easier to read it this way.
