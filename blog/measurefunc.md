# Step 7: Measure Functions

We have discussed the concept of finding a normal form, or end result, from an ARS. How do we know that we have reached the normal form? How do we show termination, an end to the computations? Like an invariant, a measure function is something that we can find that helps us. In a measure function, the basic premise is that the measure function used on a later step would have a
