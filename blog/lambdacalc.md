# Step 4 Lambda Calculus

Lambda calculus is both fun and confusing to first understand. Lambda calculus consists of 3 types of expressions. 
```
E :: = x 
E1 E2
\x.E
```
E signifies an expression. First, an expression is made up of a name. Second. two expressions next to each other means that the first expression takes the second expression as input. Third, to define what the expression does, use a \ before the variable that the expression fill the input as then a period (this syntax will be used just because it is easier to write it this way). The E after the \. is the code on what the expression does.
