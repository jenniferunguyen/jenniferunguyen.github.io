# Step 4: Lambda Calculus

Lambda calculus consists of 3 types of expressions. 
```
x 
E1 E2
\x.E
```
First, an expression, E, is made up of variables. Second. two expressions next to each other means that the first expression takes the second expression as input (known as application). Third, to define what the expression does, use a \ before the variable that the expression fill the input as then a period (this syntax will be used just because it is easier to write it this way). The E after the \. is the code on what the expression does (known as abstraction). An example would be 
```
(\x. x) 8
```
The result would be 8.

For lambda calculus, there exists a theorem called the [Church-Rosser theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROlXgCDA8ys). One of the biggest advantages of lambda calculus is the way abstraction works, because you can evaluate the function in any order (say one funciton on another, or the right one before the left one, or the left before the right) and still get the same answer. This makes it interesting to reduce lambda calculus expressions because you know that there are multiple ways to reduce it to the normal form. Added to the fact that the expression x can be anything, from a variable to lines of code. Let's see a simple case. We have the following:
```
(\x. x) (4 * 2)
```
One way to reduce is call by name, where you do application and replace the variable in the function with inputs. 
```
(\x. x) (4 * 2)
(4 * 2)
8
```
Another way is to do call by value, where you evaluate the argument first.
```
(\x. x) (4 * 2)
(\x. x) 8
8
```
In both ways, the final reduction goes to 8.

Parentheses and spaces between letters are also very important to lambda calculus, because it defines the parse tree for the execution. `(\x. x) x y` returns `x` while `(\x. x) xy` returns `xy`.

## Bound vs. Unbound Variables
Bound variables are variables that are inside the definition of a function. Unbound or free variables are variables outside the function. In the following `(\x. x) y`, the x is a bound variable and the y is free.

## Beta Reduction
Beta reduction is what we have shown: replacing the bound variable with the argument. This can be further explains using de brujin indexes. De brujin indexes assign numerical values to the bound variables. For example, take `\x. \y. \z. (x y) z`. We assign a number to each of the 3 bound variables, based on how many 'binders' the variable is in. By doing this, we replace the variables, or eliminate the use of them, by using numbers. Our example can be rewritten as `\ \ \ (3 2) 1`. The importance here is called alpha equivalence: the name of the variable doesn't matter in lambda calculus. \x. x and \y. y would evaluate the same, therefore we can do away with explicitly using bound variables.

## Eta Reduction
Eta reduction is different. Eta reduction allows us to simplify an equation in the event that the function can't do any more beta reduction with its argument. For example, we have an expression `\x.\y. x + y`. We can actually reduce this to just `+`. Another example follows:
```
(\f. f x)(\y. g y)
(\f. f x) g
g x
```
It can be seen that we have reduced the expression even though we lack a free Variable.
